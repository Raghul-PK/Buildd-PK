**All my learnings while building this app comes here;**

**UI/UX**
1. Inspired from Google's Read Along and LinkedIn. However, the overall Poor look quality might be attributed to the person who built this project (me)
2. Idea is to create lots of interactive touch-points for the user to learn actively instead of just passive consuming

**New Feature (added)**
1. Descriptions for MCQs answers
2. Notes : So, that the user can quickly jot down thoughts that pop up while learning 

**New Feature ideas (to add)**
1. Magic Searchbar : Ask it anything related to businness/products. It will provide you answers regarding the question/problem asked and find and load relevant posts and learning sections for the user to skill them up.
